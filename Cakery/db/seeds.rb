Baker.create(name: "Antony", employment_status: "Active" , bio: "Describing himself as a “Bollywood baker”, Antony grew up in India, where he learned to bake with his father. It is his father who remains his inspiration – it’s thanks to him that Antony got serious about baking. Antony’s adventurous attitude to flavour profiling is the result of a willingness to try new foods, his determination to ask probing questions of established bakers, and – in particular – his cultural roots and his travels around the world. His bold, inquisitive nature has enabled him to collect ideas and techniques that he is unafraid to use in his own creations, making his bakes at times unconventional and always interesting. He takes his research very seriously: he once tasted 50 choux buns during a single trip to Paris.", img_url: "https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/New-Project-4.jpg" , quote: Faker::Quote.unique.most_interesting_man_in_the_world, star_baker: false, bakery_id: 1)

While that can cause stress during the cooking and making itself, he aims for well thought-through results, with every bake created with a genuine and knowledgeable appreciation for the process. He is a full-time father to two small children, so home-baking is part of his everyday life.

Now, she can knock up profiteroles, Religieuse buns, tartes au citron, and even foot long eclairs to rival any French bakery.

Her bustling, mixed-heritage background is reflected in her open attitude to all styles of baking, loving rustic baking just as much as she loves creating cute bakes with an emphasis on detail. Her baking passion, though, is bread – she has turned her hand to pretty much every style and type of bread there is.", img_url: "https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/New-Project-6.jpg" , quote: Faker::Quote.unique.most_interesting_man_in_the_world, star_baker: true, bakery_id: 1)

As a research scientist, Rahul’s instinct is to undertake every bake with a forensic attitude to research and an uncompromising attention to detail.
